🚀 WDD 231: Personal Portfolio & Progress Tracker
Welcome to my WDD-231 Web Front-end Development I repo — a hands-on showcase of my journey through the fourth term of the Software Development BSc at BYU-Idaho.

This space is where design meets code, and where concepts evolve into clean, responsive, and interactive web experiences. 💻✨

🎓 About the Course
WDD231 is all about turning structure into strategy. In this course, I’m diving deep into:

✅ Semantic HTML5

🎨 Advanced CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)

⚙️ JavaScript for interactivity (DOM, Events, localStorage)

🚀 Web Performance & UX Optimization

🧠 Real version control using Git + GitHub

📅 Week 1: Home Page Launch
To kick things off, I’ve created a responsive course home page that showcases both my technical skills and my academic progress.
It’s more than a landing page — it’s an interactive portal that grows with my learning. 🔥
