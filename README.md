# 🌐 WDD 231 – Web Front-End Dev I  
### 🚀 Personal Portfolio & Final Project: Spanish Hub  
> *“Learning by doing. Building by learning.”*

Hi! I'm **Tiago Borges**, and this repo is my digital playground for **WDD-231** at **BYU-Idaho**.  
Over 7 weeks I sharpened my skills in **semantic HTML, modern CSS, and modular JavaScript** — and it all comes together in my **final project: Spanish Hub**.

## 🎯 What’s Inside?
This repo is more than coursework. It’s a **portfolio**, a **progress tracker**, and a **real-world project** I plan to expand beyond the classroom.

Built with:
- ✅ **Semantic HTML5** – Clean, accessible structure.  
- 🎨 **Modern CSS** – Variables, Flexbox, Grid, and mobile-first magic.  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM, events, async/await, localStorage, modular code.  
- 📡 **JSON & APIs** – Dynamic data loading and external integrations.  
- 📈 **UX & Performance** – Fast, responsive, user-focused.

## 💡 Why Spanish Hub?  

I chose this theme because I was a Spanish teacher in the past and I intend to use this project in the **real world**.  
I am currently creating full Spanish courses on the **Hotmart platform**, which will feature a members-only area.  
This website will serve as a **showcase (vitrine)** for those courses.  

At the same time, I plan to offer **free courses** to help children and teenagers improve their Spanish skills.
