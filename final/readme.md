## 🚀 About The Project

**Spanish Hub** is a fully responsive Spanish learning platform designed to provide an interactive and dynamic experience.  
It features courses organized by levels, practical tools, quizzes, and resources **dynamically** loaded from **JSON files** and **external APIs**, making maintenance and scalability easier.

> Developed as the final project for the **WDD 231 – BYU-Idaho** course, applying **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **modular JavaScript**.

"I chose this theme because I was a Spanish teacher in the past and I intend to use this project in the real world. I am currently working on creating courses within the Hotmart platform, which will include a members-only area and more features. 
This website will serve as a showcase for those courses. Additionally, I plan to offer free courses to help children and teenagers improve their Spanish skills."
